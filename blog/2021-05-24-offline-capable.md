![Unplugged Tanuki](/img/offline_capable_small.png)

He is Unplugged Tanuki. He is usually offline and occasionally online. He is always having fun, no matter where he is.

This illustration is my drawing that shows an offline-first concept. Offline-first is a design paradigm that ensures your app works offline as well as online.

A multi-primary database is an essential component for this paradigm.  In a multi-primary database, the data you have is not the server's cache but the original data. So, you need not get your initial data from a server. 

You are free from the internet connection.  
You can store your data in distributed place. 
Moreover,  you can synchronize your distributed data with each other when online. 

And this is [GitDocumentDB](https://gitddb.com).
