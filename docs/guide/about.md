# About

GitDocumentDB is an offline-first DocumentDB that synchronizes with Git.

Use GitDocumentDB to ...

:green_book: Store JSON documents into Git repository. 

:art: Manage Git repository by document database API. 

:rocket: Synchronize, diff and patch automatically with a remote repository.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(No need to resolve conflicts manually.)

:arrows_counterclockwise: CI/CD through GitHub.

:dromedary_camel: Travel revisions.

The throughput in GitDocumentDB is about the same as Git. It's not fast like typical databases. 

However, GitDocumentDB is compatible with Git that enables distributed multi-primary databases with revision history. Besides, it has a fully automated diff, patch, and sync with remote Git repository, automated combining of inconsistent repositories, and accessible CRUD and collection APIs for operating JSON. 

So, GitDocumentDB is helpful for people who develop Git-powered offline-first apps.
