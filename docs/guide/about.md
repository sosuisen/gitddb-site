# About

GitDocumentDB is a TypeScript ready offline-first database that synchronizes with Git.

Use GitDocumentDB to ...

:nut_and_bolt: Develop offline-capable applications using Git.

:green_book: Manage JSON documents in Git repository by CRUD and collection APIs. 

:rocket: Synchronize automatically with a remote repository.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(No need to resolve conflicts manually!)*

:arrows_counterclockwise: Integrate CI/CD pipelines through GitHub.

:dromedary_camel: Get revision history of a document.

## Pros and cons
GitDocumentDB is compatible with Git that brings us distributed multi-primary databases and efficient CI/CD.
It automates Git synchronization workflows by resolving transactional and consistency conflicts, besides revision conflicts. Typical synchronization patterns and diff-and-patch strategies solve them. Accessible CRUD and collection APIs for working with JSON reduce tasks. JavaScript/TypeScript API for Node.js and browser easily enables multi-platform.

The throughput of GitDocumentDB is about the same as Git. It is not as fast as typical databases. Storage size grows when managing many revisions of a document. These are a trade-off for Git features.
