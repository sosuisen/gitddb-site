# About

GitDocumentDB is an offline-first DocumentDB that synchronizes with Git.

Use GitDocumentDB to ...

:nut_and_bolt: Develop offline-first applications using Git.

:green_book: Manage JSON documents in Git repository by CRUD and collection APIs. 

:rocket: Synchronize automatically with a remote repository.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(No need to resolve conflicts manually!)*

:arrows_counterclockwise: Integrate CI/CD pipelines through GitHub.

:dromedary_camel: Get revision history of a document.

## Pros and cons
GitDocumentDB is compatible with Git that brings us distributed multi-primary databases and efficient CI/CD.
It automates Git synchronization workflows by resolving revision conflicts, transactional and consistency conflicts. Typical synchronization patterns and diff-and-patch strategies solve them. Accessible CRUD and collection APIs for working with JSON reduce tasks.

The throughput of GitDocumentDB is about the same as Git. It is not as fast as typical databases. However, it is beneficial for those who are developing offline-first applications using Git.
